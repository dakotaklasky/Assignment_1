At each round of play the player places a bet. After that, the player and the dealer each draw one card from the deck.The player is then repeatedly asked if another card is wanted. The player can continue to draw cards while the total is less than 71/2. After the player's turn is over, the dealer's cards are shown. The dealer's play is always the same: the dealer continues to draw cards only if the total is less than 51/2.
